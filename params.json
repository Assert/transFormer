{"name":"Transformer","tagline":"Easy to use JavaScript two way binding framework.","body":"### transFormer.js\r\nThis is a lightweight JavaScript templating and binding framework. It lets you bind JSON-objects directly to your HTML-markup. Convention over configuration is the key to this framework and the JSON will be bound to HTML-elements with matching IDs. \r\n\r\nTo bind an array of objects to your HTML you can template it, so that you only write the HTML once, and use it as a template.\r\n\r\nYou can also make JSON-objects directly from your form-elements. Make objects that contain data, arrays and other objects just the way you want them without any code required. All you might need are some declarative attributes in your form-elements.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar json = {\r\n    name: \"Bob Doe\",\r\n    country: \"Norway\",\r\n    age : \"31\"\r\n};\r\ntransFormer.bind(json);\r\n```\r\nThe bind function will look for HTML-elements with matching IDs. Like the one below:\r\n```\r\n    <h2 id=\"name\"></h2>\r\n    <div id=\"country\"></div>\r\n    <div id=\"age\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nGet your copy of transFormer.js from GitHub or Nuget.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
